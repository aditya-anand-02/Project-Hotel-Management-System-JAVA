# Project-Hotel-Management-System-JAVA 
This is a Hotel Management tool that runs as a menu-driven program until the user exits. It offers various functionalities such as storing customer details, booking rooms of four different types, ordering food for particular rooms, unbooking rooms, and generating bills. The program utilizes file handling to store the current status of the hotel, including customer details, booked rooms, and food orders, in a file upon program exit. This ensures that the old details are not lost when the program is restarted. Additionally, the program reads the file upon restart to retrieve the previous status of the hotel. To optimize performance, the writing of the file has been implemented in a separate thread for parallel execution. Proper exception handling is in place to deal with any unexpected exceptions. Moreover, if the user attempts to book an already allotted room, a user-defined exception is thrown. This comprehensive Hotel Management tool also provides information on different room features and availability. The project implements Object Oriented Programming principles and techniques.
